* As a customer, I want to be able to complete a booking form so that I can make a booking for a lawn service.
* As a customer, I want to be able to contact the company so that I can confirm/cancel my appointment.
* As a prospective customer, I want to be able to view a service list so that I can see prices and check that the business caters to my lawn requirements
* As a business owner, I want to have a user friendly website so that my existing and potential new clients can make a booking and contact the business easily
* As a business owner, I want to be able to securely log on to the website so that I can view and manage (create/update/delete) my clients bookings accordingly
* As a business owner, I want my customers to have the ability to make their own booking online and select their service type so that I have their details recorded in the database and so they can make the booking at any time
* As a business owner, I want to ensure that only the areas which are serviceable can be booked so the business does not receive a booking for a location which is not serviced
* As a business owner, I want to be able to retrieve a list of bookings for a specified day so that I can see what jobs I have for that day and plan my day accordingly
